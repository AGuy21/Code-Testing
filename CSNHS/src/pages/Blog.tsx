            I do mobile application development as my main hobby. I also dive
            into programming algorithums or scripts with python. And as of right
            now i am learning React.Js for website creation.

            I got into programming at 11/9/2023 I got into programming at the
            time when i first learned about React Native halfway through my 10th
            grade Foundations of Programming class. I was instantly facsinated
            by the idea of making an entire app from the ground up based on my
            ideas alone and how there were no limits, After all i was already
            into PC building how phones work and other techy stuff like that.
            So, when i got home that day and spent the whole day setting up and
            learning about how to use IDE's, Code Formatters, and Github. After
            i got all this set up i spent the entire next day daydreaming about
            what i would build first and i even tried to learn the syntax there.
            From then on for around 2 weeks i did tutorials, learned syntax,
            tech stacks, frameworks, and even did some challenging coding
            problems on my own to help connect my problem-solving skills to
            computer science. When i finally started understand the language i
            decided to make my biggest step yet; My first ever App.

            Inside my 10th engineering class one day we were going to start a
            new project called "Project Innovation". The rules were simple,
            create an idea on your own that we will present and build off of.
            There were many categories to choose from but one, "Make a Game"
            caught my eye. Though, most people would use scratch and make a
            simple indie game i thought, "I should use my React Native knowlege
            to make my own mobile game". Now this was tricky at the time since
            react native isn't meant to make mobile games it is mostly for
            social media apps, budgeting apps, and other useful tools. But i
            decided to challenge myself and prove to myself the knowlege i have
            gained up until now was worth my time. So i made my first ever app
            that i put in my github repository called "App" and i don't want to
            change it since it even though it looks weird in my repo since it is
            a sense of accomplishment for me. Now the app wasn't too good really
            there are many things that were bad but some things good. I was even
            able to help my brother in sharing his skills for art by using his
            art and linking it to commisioning if anyone wanted him to do the
            art. But at the time i learned so many things that have shaped me up
            until now. When i presented this app it wasn't considered good but
            it was the best in the school since no one in the school at the time
            made a game that wasn't in scratch. Some people played it and the
            people close to my teacher at the time loved the idea. But i knew
            this was just the beginning and that if i wanted to do better i
            would need to improve my skills and learn off of this stepping
            stone.

            After that slight-success i got a sense of accomplishment and used
            that to learn more and then start my second App, Budget-Buddy. This
            project is way better than my last, I had way more readable code, i
            followed coding standards more, and i learned how to optomize both
            my code and my time. But when i was working through this almost 6
            hours a day every day including school time, i finally, Burnt out.

          <div className="font-sans text-textfordark xl:text-3xl md:text-2xl text-xl font-bold text-left">
            After getting almost 75% through my new app Budget-Buddy, after 2
            Months from first starting this journy by tirelessly coding for
            every second of freetime i had inbetween school & work at the
            waterparks, this unhealthy strain every day it finally caught up and
            i lost all will to code, or even go on my computer for that matter.
            I stopped coding for months, to be exact i stopped coding for 5
            months and 1 week. This was devestating since it ruined all of my
            knowlege at the time and i would need a refresher and a boost if i
            wanted to get back into coding. But, even though this burn out was
            very bad towards my coding skills and all i worked up to at that
            point i learned alot. With this burnout the feeling of guilt that i
            got from not coding made me want to work and i understood at the
            time that my academics were lacking so to make up for my guilt of
            not working i made a new outlook on school and started trying to
            excel in school throughout the burnout. I also understood what it
            was like to over-work one's self and how to prevent it.

            After a while of working on my academics and working at a new job
            after quiting my own throughout summer, i decided to make my first
            big leap back into coding on 9/8/2024, When my Juinor year in
            highschool began i went about it like most years until the club
            fair. During the club fair i decided that i would join the hackathon
            club, CSNHS, and other computer science related clubs. With this i
            started the creation of a Pet Adoption App so i could refresh my
            memory on coding so i wouldn't be going in without the skills i have
            aquired. But, a new opportunity came up at Northrop Grumman to
            become an intern there and help with cybersecurity. Now i've done my
            fair share of ethical hacking but i wouldn't say i am good at it but
            the idea of having a goal as big as this to strive for got me
            excited as i know my dad is in cybersecurity and i also share a
            likeing in cybersecurity. So i decided to apply and improve my
            skills throughout the application process by creating a new app, A
            Pet Adoption App. This app i decided to only work on in little
            increments that would increase in time throught the week then reset
            to keep myself away from burning out. When i finally sent the
            application i said to myself "If this goes through i will pursue
            Cybersecurity as my career if not, i will pursure Mobile App
            development".

            The Application results came in, I, Sadly, Didn't make it. Though, i
            wasn't devestated i decided i would follow what i said and pursue
            Mobile App Development as my career. So, i decided i would join my
            CSNHS club as a coach and teach people react native. Not only to
            spread my love for React Native but to learn more about it and
            different perspectives on mobile app devlopment.

            After applying to be a coach for CSNHS i was tasked to create a
            website. I was super nervous because i havent made a website before,
            But i was tasked to make the website with React, Which luckily for
            me is similar to React Native. So with this website i would both get
            the refresher i wanted for react native. And hopefully make it into
            CSNHS as a coach and prove to myself once again, that i have what it
            takes to pursue programming as my main career. So i have made my
            first ever website, titles "CSNHS" and we will see if i make it into
            CSNHS as a coach, or not.
