This was my first ever self made project. It is a mobile fantasy idle clicker game.
This is named 'App' for nostalgia sake, This app is made with React Native using Typescript.
The app most notably contains a map where the user will progress the game's challenges. It also has a blacksmith to increase their dark matter per click and dark matter per second.
The player can choose between two classes in the game that go against each other on the leaderboard to add a infinite challenge to be better than everyone else creating compotition.
The art is made by Logan Perez my brother. He has given me all rights to use his art.
